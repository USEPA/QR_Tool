# SQUIREL
SQUIREL is a lightweight tool for creating sample label designs and generating QR codes for use with data acquisition systems in the field or the laboratory. Users can generate labels by entering study-specific nomenclature into the fields below. Additional columns can be added by clicking the 'Add Column' button to expand the format of each label. Rows can be added to include multiple label designs within a single instance. Alternatively, QR codes can be generated by directly importing a CSV file by clicking the 'Upload' button. Label sizes can be formatted to fit specific printing dimensions by clicking the 'Page Layout' button.
